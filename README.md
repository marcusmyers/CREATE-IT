#CREATE IT! Conference Presentation

##Pulling strings to manage your district devices.
Being a Puppeteer of your districts network with one platform has been made easy by the server software available for that platform. Even in a one platform district all the server tools available to help manage your devices can come at a cost. Trying to pull all the right strings at a multi-platform district is like working with another puppeteer you haven’t worked with before. When looking for resources to help manage those machines that don’t break the bank can leave you with your strings tangled up. Enter puppet, an open source configuration management software.

In this session we will introduce the concept of puppet and how it can be used to manage your district machines. How we use open source package management software with puppet to manage most software installs. This introductory session will help explain how to use puppet for the win.
